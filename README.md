# Matlab-STL-Files
This folder contains matlab files pertaining to creating mesh files in ASCII text and stl format
based on this file's example 2: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/20922-stlwrite-write-ascii-or-binary-stl-files

First attempt at creating 3D structure from exported mesh coordinates- filename'STL_Write_ascii.m'
tumor_mesh_XYZvals_9_9.xlsx contains the exported coordinates

Wondering if my problem is lack of information to connect the coordinates?
